 * \brief Map from 3D unit right cylinder to a volume that connects
 *  portions of two spherical surfaces.
 *
 * \image html CylindricalEndcap.svg "A cylinder maps to the shaded region."
 *
 * \details Consider two spheres with centers \f$C_1\f$ and \f$C_2\f$,
 * and radii \f$R_1\f$ and \f$R_2\f$. Let sphere 1 be intersected by a
 * plane normal to the \f$z\f$ axis and located at \f$z = z_\mathrm{P}\f$.
 * Also let there be a projection point \f$P\f$.
 *
 * CylindricalEndcap maps a 3D unit right cylinder (with coordinates
 * \f$(\bar{x},\bar{y},\bar{z})\f$ such that \f$-1\leq\bar{z}\leq 1\f$
 * and \f$\bar{x}^2+\bar{y}^2 \leq 1\f$) to the shaded area
 * in the figure above (with coordinates \f$(x,y,z)\f$).  The "bottom"
 * of the cylinder \f$\bar{z}=-1\f$ is mapped to the portion of sphere
 * 1 that has \f$z \geq z_\mathrm{P}\f$.  Curves of constant
 * \f$(\bar{x},\bar{y})\f$ are mapped to portions of lines that pass
 * through \f$P\f$. Along each of these curves, \f$\bar{z}=-1\f$ is
 * mapped to a point on sphere 1 and \f$\bar{z}=+1\f$ is mapped to a
 * point on sphere 2.
 *
 * Note that Sphere 1 and Sphere 2 are not equivalent, because the
 * mapped portion of Sphere 1 is bounded by a plane of constant
 * \f$z\f$ but the mapped portion of Sphere 2 is not (except for
 * special choices of \f$C_1\f$, \f$C_2\f$, and \f$P\f$).
 *
 * CylindricalEndcap is intended to be composed with Wedge2D maps to
 * construct a portion of a cylindrical domain for a binary system.
 *
 * CylindricalEndcap is described briefly in the Appendix of
 * \cite Buchman:2012dw.
 * CylindricalEndcap is used to construct the blocks labeled 'CA
 * wedge', 'EA wedge', 'CB wedge', 'EE wedge', and 'EB wedge' in
 * Figure 20 of that paper.  Note that 'CA wedge', 'CB wedge', and
 * 'EE wedge' have Sphere 1 contained in Sphere 2, and 'EA wedge'
 * and 'EB wedge' have Sphere 2 contained in Sphere 1.
 *
 * CylindricalEndcap is implemented using `FocallyLiftedMap`
 * and `FocallyLiftedInnerMaps::Endcap`; see those classes for details.
 *
 * ### Restrictions on map parameters.
 *
 * We demand that either Sphere 1 is fully contained inside Sphere 2, or
 * that Sphere 2 is fully contained inside Sphere 1. It is
 * possible to construct a valid map without this assumption, but the
 * assumption simplifies the code, and the expected use cases obey
 * this restriction.
 *
 * We also demand that \f$z_\mathrm{P} > C_1^2\f$, that is, the plane
 * in the above and below figures lies to the right of \f$C_1^2\f$.
 * This restriction not strictly necessary but is made for simplicity.
 *
 * The map is invertible only for some choices of the projection point
 * \f$P\f$.  Given the above restrictions, the allowed values of
 * \f$P\f$ are illustrated by the following diagram:
 *
 * \image html CylindricalEndcap_Allowed.svg "Allowed region for P." width=75%
 *
 * The plane \f$z=z_\mathrm{P}\f$ intersects sphere 1 on a circle. The
 * cone with apex \f$C_1\f$ that intersects that circle has opening
 * angle \f$2\theta\f$ as shown in the above figure. Construct another
 * cone, the "invertibility cone", with apex \f$S\f$ chosen such that
 * the two cones intersect at right angles on the circle; thus the
 * opening angle of the invertibility cone is \f$\pi-2\theta\f$.  A
 * necessary condition for invertibility is that the projection point
 * \f$P\f$ lies inside the invertibility cone, but not between \f$S\f$
 * and sphere 1.  (If \f$P\f$ does not obey this condition, then from the
 * diagram one can find at least one line through \f$P\f$
 * that twice intersects the surface of sphere 1 with \f$z>z_\mathrm{P}\f$;
 * the inverse map is thus double-valued at those intersection points.)
 * Placing the projection point \f$P\f$ to the
 * right of \f$S\f$ (but inside the invertibility cone) is ok for
 * invertibility.
 *
 * In addition to invertibility and the two additional restrictions
 * already mentioned above, we demand a few more restrictions on the
 * map parameters to simplify the logic for the expected use cases and
 * to ensure that jacobians do not get too large. The numbers in the
 * restrictions below were chosen empirically so that the unit tests pass
 * with errors less than 100 times machine roundoff; we do not expect to
 * run into these restrictions in normal usage. We demand:
 *
 * - \f$P\f$ is not too close to the edge of the invertibility cone.
 *   Here we demand that the angle between \f$P\f$ and \f$S\f$
 *   is less than \f$0.85 (\pi/2-\theta)\f$ (note that if this
 *   angle is exactly \f$\pi/2-\theta\f$ it is exactly on the
 *   invertibility cone); The 0.85 was chosen empirically based on
 *   unit tests.
 * - \f$z_\mathrm{P}\f$ is not too close to the center or the edge of sphere 1.
 *   Here we demand that \f$0.2 \leq \cos(\theta) \leq 0.95\f$, where
 *   the values 0.2 and 0.95 were chosen empirically based on unit tests.
 * - \f$P\f$ is contained in sphere 2.
 * - If sphere 2 is contained in sphere 1, then
 *   - \f$0.1 R_1 \leq R_2 \leq 0.85 (R_1 - |C_1-C_2|)\f$,
 *     This prevents the two spheres from having a very narrow space between
 *     them, and it prevents sphere 2 from being very small.
 *   - \f$|P - C_2| < 0.1 R_2\f$, i.e. \f$P\f$ is near the center of sphere 2.
 * - If sphere 1 is contained in sphere 2, then
 *   - \f$ R_2 \geq 1.01 (R_1 + |C_1-C_2|)\f$, where the 1.01
 *     prevents the spheres from (barely) touching.
 *   - If a line segment is drawn between \f$P\f$ and any point on the
 *     intersection circle (the circle where sphere 1 intersects the
 *     plane \f$z=z_\mathrm{P}\f$), the angle between the line segment
 *     and the z-axis is smaller than \f$\pi/3\f$.
