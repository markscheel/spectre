/// Represents a 'state' of the size control system.

/// Each 'state' of the size control system has a different control
/// signal, which has a different purpose, even though each state
/// controls the same map quantity, namely the Y00 coefficient of the
/// shape map.  For example, state Label::AhSpeed controls
/// the Y00 coefficient of the shape map so that the minimum
/// characteristic speed is driven towards a target value, and state
/// Label::DeltaR controls the Y00 coefficient of the shape
/// map (or the Y00 coefficient of a separate spherically-symmetric size
/// map) so that the minimum difference between the horizon radius and
/// the excision boundary radius is driven towards a constant.
///
/// Each state has its own logic (the 'update' function) that
/// determines values of certain parameters (i.e. the things in
/// Info), including whether the control system should
/// transition to a different state.
///
/// The different states are:
/// - Initial: drives dr/dt of the excision boundary to
///   Info::target_drift_velocity.
/// - AhSpeed: drives the minimum characteristic speed on the excision boundary
///   to Info::target_char_speed.
/// - DeltaR: drives the minimum distance between the horizon and the excision
///   boundary to be constant in time.
/// - DeltaRDriftInward: Same as DeltaR but the excision boundary has a small
///   velocity inward.  This state is triggered when it is deemed that the
///   excision boundary and the horizon are too close to each other; the
///   small velocity makes the excision boundary and the horizon drift apart.
/// - DeltaRDriftOutward: Same as DeltaR but the excision boundary has a small
///   velocity outward.  This state is triggered when it is deemed that the
///   excision boundary and the horizon are too far apart.
/// - DeltaRTransition: Same as DeltaR except for the logic that
///   determines how DeltaRTransition changes to other states.
///   DeltaRTransition is allowed (under some circumstances) to change
///   to state DeltaR, but DeltaRDriftOutward and DeltaRDriftInward
///   are never allowed to change to state DeltaR.  Instead
///   DeltaRDriftOutward and DeltaRDriftInward are allowed (under
///   some circumstances) to change to state DeltaRTransition.
///
/// The reason that DeltaRDriftInward, DeltaRDriftOutward, and
/// DeltaRTransition are separate states is to simplify the logic.  In
/// principle, all 3 of those states could be merged with state
/// DeltaR, because the control error is the same for all four states
/// (except for a velocity term that could be set to zero).  But if that
/// were done, then there would need to be additional complicated
/// logic in determining transitions between different states, and
/// that logic would depend not only on the current state, but also on
/// the previous state.
