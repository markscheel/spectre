 * \brief Represents a 'state' of the size control system.
 *
 * \details Each 'state' of the size control system has a different control
 * signal, which has a different purpose, even though each state
 * controls the same map quantity, namely the Y00 coefficient of the
 * shape map.  For example, state Label::AhSpeed controls
 * the Y00 coefficient of the shape map so that the minimum
 * characteristic speed is driven towards a target value, and state
 * Label::DeltaR controls the Y00 coefficient of the shape
 * map (or the Y00 coefficient of a separate spherically-symmetric size
 * map) so that the minimum difference between the horizon radius and
 * the excision boundary radius is driven towards a constant.
 *
 * Each state has its own logic (the 'update' function) that
 * determines values of certain parameters (i.e. the things in
 * Info), including whether the control system should
 * transition to a different state.
 *
 * The different states are:
 * - Initial: drives dr/dt of the excision boundary to
 *   Info::target_drift_velocity.
 * - AhSpeed: drives the minimum characteristic speed on the excision boundary
 *   to Info::target_char_speed.
 * - DeltaR: drives the minimum distance between the horizon and the excision
 *   boundary to be constant in time.
 * - DeltaRDriftInward: Same as DeltaR but the excision boundary has a small
 *   velocity inward.  This state is triggered when it is deemed that the
 *   excision boundary and the horizon are too close to each other; the
 *   small velocity makes the excision boundary and the horizon drift apart.
 * - DeltaRDriftOutward: Same as DeltaR but the excision boundary has a small
 *   velocity outward.  This state is triggered when it is deemed that the
 *   excision boundary and the horizon are too far apart.
 * - DeltaRTransition: Same as DeltaR except for the logic that
 *   determines how DeltaRTransition changes to other states.
 *   DeltaRTransition is allowed (under some circumstances) to change
 *   to state DeltaR, but DeltaRDriftOutward and DeltaRDriftInward
 *   are never allowed to change to state DeltaR.  Instead
 *   DeltaRDriftOutward and DeltaRDriftInward are allowed (under
 *   some circumstances) to change to state DeltaRTransition.
 *
 * The reason that DeltaRDriftInward, DeltaRDriftOutward, and
 * DeltaRTransition are separate states is to simplify the logic.  In
 * principle, all 3 of those states could be merged with state
 * DeltaR, because the control error is the same for all four states
 * (except for a velocity term that could be set to zero).  But if that
 * were done, then there would need to be additional complicated
 * logic in determining transitions between different states, and
 * that logic would depend not only on the current state, but also on
 * the previous state.
